        <h3>How to Execute the Masse Shot</h3>
        <p>One of the most impressive tricks in billiards is the <strong>Masse Shot</strong>—a curved shot that lets you swerve the cue ball around obstacles. It takes serious skill, but it's super satisfying to pull off.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Grip:</strong> Hold the cue vertically, almost like you're stabbing downward.</li>
          <li><strong>Position:</strong> Aim to hit the cue ball off-center with extreme spin (English).</li>
          <li><strong>Power:</strong> Strike with a firm, controlled force to generate curve.</li>
          <li><strong>Curve:</strong> Watch as the ball bends around your target and sinks the shot!</li>
        </ol>
